## 😀 *About Me*
I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, for most of my life. In my early middle school years,  I started to code virtual games on ROBLOX using a low-level coding language called Lua. [On my profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/47934004/profile/#!/creations "my profile title"), I made two very successful games, Outrageous Chase and [Outrageous Blades](https://github.com/ethangutknecht/Outrageous-Blades), with a combined *376,000* hits, *177,000* unique users, and getting on the website's home page by the time I was 15 years old. I am also into video editing, graphic design, and marketing. I think these skills complement each other within computer science, so I take pride in putting time into both simultaneously! Feel free to look at any projects I posted and shoot me any questions if needed!

<h4> Bachelor of Science in Computer Science </h4>

Miami University is a public research university in Oxford, Ohio. The university was founded in 1809, making it the second-oldest university in Ohio and the 10th oldest public university in the United States. I am attending [Miami University's College of Engineering and Computing](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/) on Miami's main campus, taking many different CSE courses to expand my knowledge within this field and find what part of computer science I like best.
