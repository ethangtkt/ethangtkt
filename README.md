## 😀 *About Me*
I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio for the majority of my life. I started to get into computers my early middle school years coding virtual games on ROBLOX within a low level coding languge called Lua. I made two very successful games on [my profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/47934004/profile/#!/creations "my profile title") with *376,000* hits, *177,000* unique users, and getting on the website's home page by the time I was 15 years old! As of now, I am a junior studying towards a bachelors degree within computer science. I am attending Miami Universirty in the lovely Oxford, Ohio taking many different CSE courses to expand my knowledge within this feild and find exactly what part of computer science I like best. I am also into video editing, graphic design, and marketing. I think all of these skills complement each other within computer science, hence why I take pride in putting time into both simultaniously! Feel free to take a look at any projects I posted and shoot me any questions if needed!
