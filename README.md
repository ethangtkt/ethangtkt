## About Me
#### 🎓 Classes I've Taken:
- 💽 Data Abstractions & Structures
    - Abstract data types and their implementation as data structures using object-oriented programming. 
    - Use of object-oriented principles in the selection and analysis of various ADT implementations. 
    - Sequential and linked storage representations: lists, stacks, queues, and tables. 
    - Nonlinear data structures: trees and graphs. Recursion, sorting, searching, and algorithm complexity.
- 🔐 Systems I & II
    - Introduced to operating systems concepts and using it as a resource manager. The principles for the design and implementation of operating systems. 
    - Process scheduling and deadlock prevention. Memory management, virtual memory, paging, segmentation, and interrupt processing.  
    - Device management, I/O systems and I/O processing. Concurrency and multithreading. Virtualization and cloud services. Security and protection.
- ⏰ Algorithms
    - Designed, analyze and implementation of algorithms and data structures. 
    - Dynamic programming, brute force algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, red-black trees, string matching and computational geometry.
- 📱  Mobile App Development
    - Implementation of cross-platform applications for mobile platforms such as iOS and Android. 
    - Programming languages, development environments, debugging, testing, and application design. 
    - Developed applications that: provide an effective graphical interface, access internet resources, permanently store data, access the device’s hardware, and display graphical elements.
- 💿 Database Systems
    - Overview of database management, database system architecture, and database modeling principles. Logical database design.
    - The relational database model, relational integrity constraints, and relational algebra. Relational commercial database management systems and languages.
    - Interactive database processing, view processing, and database application programming.
    - Database integrity, relational database design by normalization, and file structures for database systems.
- 💻 Web Application Programming
    - An introduction to the software, concepts and methodologies necessary to design and implement web applications. 
    - Designed and construct web applications utilizing remote servers on multiple platforms. 
- 🖼 Foundations of Graphics
    - Introduced techniques used to create images on the computer.
    - Covered the algorithms and mathematical theory behind three dimensional image generation with an emphasis on 3D geometry, 3D transformations, and the graphics pipeline.
